# RFM_Customer_Segmentation
This is one of the three notebooks on my Customer Segmentation project. To understand the process of acquiring and cleaning the data, please, visit the **Time Series** part of the project. 

Make sure you check out the other parts:

For our Customer Segmentation, we'll be doing a **RFM** analysis.

According to [clevertap.com](https://clevertap.com/blog/rfm-analysis/) RFM stands for **Recency**, **Frequency**, and **Monetary** value, each corresponding to some key customer trait. These RFM metrics are important indicators of a customer’s behavior because frequency and monetary value affects a customer’s lifetime value, and recency affects retention, a measure of engagement.

### Why is it important? What can we get from it?

* Who are your best customers?
* Which of your customers could contribute to your churn rate?
* Who has the potential to become valuable customers?
* Which of your customers can be retained?
* Which of your customers are most likely to respond to engagement campaigns?

These are key questions that we can answer with this analysis. Let's get it going.
